\chapter{References}
You must include a list of references that you cite to support facts that are not common knowledge or expert opinions that you include in your report. In general, it is better not to use a bibliography of sources consulted for general background knowledge; instead, make a habit of citing the sources that you actually use. The format of the citations (which appear within the body of your report), and the format of the list of references (that appears near the end of the report, just before the appendices) should follow the guidelines described by the library.
