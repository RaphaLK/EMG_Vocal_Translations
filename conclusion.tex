\begin{itemize}
  \item Summarize what you did. This can be viewed as the evidence.
  \item State what you learned (the actual conclusions that you are drawing), and relate them to the project objectives.
  \item List the advantages and disadvantages of your work. In what ways is your solution deficient or lacking? You are not divulging a weakness in your work when you state problems that still remain.
  \item State directions for future work and list any open problems.
