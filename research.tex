\chapter{User Research - example middle chapter}

\section{Methods}
Describe what methods you have used to identify user needs. This can include methods such as storyboards and interviews and surveys with target users. Describe how you analyze the data you collect. Include an example. 

\section{Stakeholder needs}
Who are the stakeholders for this system? Provide a short description of what you know (so far) about each of the stakeholders and their needs. Highlight cases where their needs may differ. Personas could be appropriate here.

Describe whose needs your system will prioritize. It is ok to state that a potential stakeholder is out of scope for the project. For example, a virtual tour of the SCU campus might target prospective students, but choose \textit{not} optimize for their parents (who are also potential stakeholders/viewers, but have different needs).

\section{User stories} 
For each stakeholder that you choose to prioritize, describe one or more user stories that your system will support, e.g., "As a prospective student, I want to find a social group at SCU so that I have friends to hang out with."
